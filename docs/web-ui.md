# Web UI Guide

gitrieve ships with a built-in web UI for managing archive jobs and configuration through a browser, instead of the CLI commands. This guide covers how to start the server, access the UI, and configure it.

## Starting the server

Build gitrieve and launch the server command:

```bash
gitrieve build -o gitrieve main.go
# or, if already installed:
gitrieve server
```

You must have a `config.yaml` in place (or pass `-c <path>`), just like the CLI commands. The server reads your repository and storage configuration and lets you manage them at runtime.

```bash
gitrieve -c config.yaml server
```

On startup you will see:

```
Starting server on localhost:8080
```

## Accessing the UI

Open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

The default host is `localhost` and the default port is `8080`. Static assets (CSS/JS) are served from `/static/*`.

## Features

### Job management

- **Trigger an archive** — start a job for any repository defined in your config.
- **View job history** — list past and current jobs with status, start/end time, and error messages. Filter by status or repository, and paginate.
- **Cancel a job** — stop a running or pending job.
- **Real-time logs** — every job has a live log stream that updates as the job runs, using Server-Sent Events. The stream closes automatically when the job finishes.

### Repository sync health

The Repositories page is a server-paginated fleet overview. Summary cards show
total, healthy, failed, syncing, never-synced, and overdue counts across every
repository matching the current text search, not only the visible page. Health,
overdue, and stuck filters plus attention/name/last-attempt/last-success sorting
are kept in the URL hash, so exception views can be bookmarked.

Each row deliberately shows both the last attempt and last successful
completion. A recent failed attempt must not make an older successful backup
look recent. Primary health uses this precedence: never synced; stuck; pending
or running; failed or cancelled; overdue; healthy. Overdue and stuck are also
shown as independent diagnostics.

Open a row's execution detail to see the exact latest execution, its component
outcomes, and its logs. Code is always enabled; release, issues, wiki, and
discussion appear when configured. Unsupported capabilities are `skipped` and
do not fail an execution. A real failure in any enabled component makes the
overall execution `failed`, although later components are still attempted.
Older executions created before component tracking show that component details
are unavailable instead of inventing results.

Bulk retry operates on the complete server-side failed/cancelled/overdue
selection. The confirmation displays the eligible count. If that count changes
before submission, the server returns the new count and the UI asks again.
Active or no-longer-eligible repositories are safely accounted for, and one
enqueue failure does not stop the remaining repositories.

**Refresh is always explicit.** The Repositories page never polls, schedules a
timer reload, or reloads because a job's SSE stream completes. Click **Refresh**
or revisit the page to see later server-side changes.

### Configuration management

- **Repositories** — add, edit, and remove repository entries from your `config.yaml` without editing the file by hand. Changes are persisted back to the config file.
- **Storage backends** — add, edit, and remove `file` and `s3` storage backends. Changes are persisted back to the config file.

All write operations update the in-memory config immediately and then attempt to save it to disk. If the save fails (for example, the config file is read-only), the change still takes effect for the running server, and the API response will carry a warning message.

## Configuration

The server is configured via an optional `server` section in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  host: localhost        # bind address
  port: 8080             # listen port
  authEnabled: false     # require a bearer token for API access
  authToken: ""          # the token clients must send when authEnabled is true
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | `localhost` | Network address to bind |
| `port` | `8080` | Port to listen on |
| `authEnabled` | `false` | When `true`, API requests must include the bearer token |
| `authToken` | `""` | Token value sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |

A complete example combining the server section with the rest of the config:

```yaml
server:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8080
  authEnabled: true
  authToken: "change-me-in-production"

repository:
  - name: gitrieve
    url: github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve
    cron: "0 * * * *"
    storage:
      - localFile
    useCache: true
    allBranches: true
    depth: 0
    downloadReleases: true
    downloadIssues: true
    downloadWiki: true
    downloadDiscussion: true

storage:
  - name: localFile
    type: file
    path: ./repo

githubToken: your-github-token
syncOverdueGrace: 30m
syncStuckThreshold: 24h
cocurrencyNum: 6
```

The `server` process executes every non-empty repository `cron` schedule. Cron
registrations are refreshed immediately when repositories are created, updated,
or deleted through the API, and after config import or reload.

`syncOverdueGrace` defaults to `30m` and prevents a repository from being
declared overdue immediately after its cron time. `syncStuckThreshold` defaults
to `24h` and flags unusually long-running work. Non-positive values select
those defaults. `cocurrencyNum` is intentionally spelled as shown and limits
actual executor work shared by cron, manual runs, and bulk retries; excess work
waits as `pending`. Duplicate active work for the same repository is rejected.
At startup the server reconciles executions left `pending` or `running` by the
previous process to `failed`, including active component rows.

## Security notes

- **Auth is off by default.** With `authEnabled: false`, anyone who can reach the server can trigger archive jobs, view logs, and modify your repository/storage configuration. Only run with auth disabled on a trusted network.
- **Use a strong `authToken`.** When `authEnabled: true`, set a long, random token. Clients send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every API request. See the [API reference](api.md#authentication) for details.
- **Bind carefully.** The default `host: localhost` only accepts connections from the same machine. To expose the server to other machines, set `host: 0.0.0.0` (or a specific interface) and put it behind a reverse proxy with TLS.
- **No TLS built in.** The server listens over plain HTTP. For remote access, terminate TLS at a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.) in front of gitrieve.
- **Config file writes.** The server writes back to `config.yaml` when you edit repositories or storage through the UI/API. Ensure the file is writable by the user running gitrieve, and protect the file because it may contain storage credentials and tokens.
