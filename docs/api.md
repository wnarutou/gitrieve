# API Reference

gitrieve provides an HTTP API for managing archive jobs, repositories, and storage backends through its web server. This document describes every endpoint exposed by `gitrieve server`.

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Base URL** | `http://localhost:8080` (default; see [Web UI](web-ui.md) for how to change host/port) |
| **Content type** | `application/json` for request and response bodies |
| **Response envelope** | All JSON endpoints return a `Response` object (see below) |

Every JSON endpoint returns the same envelope:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": { /* endpoint-specific payload, or null */ },
  "message": "" /* non-empty on partial failure, e.g. config not persisted */
}
```

The HTTP status code matches `code` on the happy path (e.g. `200`, `404`, `500`). `message` carries human-readable detail on error or when a write succeeded in memory but could not be persisted to the config file.

## Authentication

The server supports an optional bearer-token mode, controlled by the `server` section of `config.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
  authEnabled: true
  authToken: "your-secret-token"
```

When `server.authEnabled` is `true`, API clients must send the token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token
```

Requests missing or mismatching the token are rejected. When `authEnabled` is `false` (the default), no authentication is required. This applies to API endpoints under `/api/*`; the web UI at `/` and static assets under `/static/*` are served regardless.

> Note: token-based auth is defined in the server config schema. Verify your build wires up the auth middleware before relying on it in production.

## Jobs

All server-originated work (cron, single-job requests, and bulk retries) enters
the same executor queue. `cocurrencyNum` (the existing spelling) limits actual
running work; accepted work remains `pending` until a slot is available. A
repository cannot have two pending/running executions. On server startup, any
execution and component left pending/running by the previous process is marked
`failed` with an interruption message, so a restart cannot leave permanent
active rows.

### Create a job

Trigger an archive job for a repository defined in configuration.

```
POST /api/jobs
```

**Request body**

```json
{
  "repository_key": "github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repository_key` | string | yes | The repository identity key — the normalized URL (e.g. `github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve`) of a repository defined in `config.yaml`. For `user`/`org` entries, use the synthesized `https://github.com/<orgName>` (server normalizes it). A bare display name is not accepted. |

**Response `data`**

```json
{
  "job_ids": ["1719800000", "1719800001"],
  "status": "pending"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `job_ids` | array of string | One job identifier per expanded repository; pass each to the logs/cancel endpoints. A `repo`-type entry yields a single ID; a `user`/`org` entry yields one ID per concrete member repository |
| `status` | string | Always `pending`: accepted jobs wait for an executor slot before becoming `running` |

**Example**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repository_key": "github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve"}'
```

**Status codes**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Job queued |
| 400 | Invalid request body |
| 409 | The repository already has a `pending` or `running` execution |
| 404 | Repository not found in configuration |
| 500 | Failed to start the job |

---

### Bulk retry repositories

Retry the current server-side set of failed, cancelled, or overdue repositories.
The request selects repositories rather than supplying a page-sized ID list.

```
POST /api/jobs/bulk
```

**Request body**

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "search": "github.com/acme",
    "health": "failed",
    "overdue": false
  },
  "expected_count": 37
}
```

`selector.search`, `selector.health`, and `selector.overdue` use the same
meaning as the repository-list filters. The server intersects that selection
with repositories currently eligible to retry: latest status `failed` or
`cancelled`, or `overdue=true`. Stuck executions are active and are never
eligible; cancel them first. `expected_count` is the count the operator
confirmed in the UI.

The server recomputes the eligible count immediately before enqueueing. If it
differs from `expected_count`, the response is `409 Conflict` with the new
count, and the client must show a new confirmation:

```json
{
  "code": 409,
  "data": {"actual_count": 39},
  "message": "Eligible repository count changed"
}
```

On success, every repository in the confirmed snapshot is accounted for:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "requested": 37,
    "queued": 34,
    "skipped_active": 1,
    "no_longer_eligible": 1,
    "failed_to_enqueue": 1
  },
  "message": ""
}
```

The endpoint rechecks each repository and continues after an individual
failure. Therefore `requested` always equals `queued + skipped_active +
no_longer_eligible + failed_to_enqueue`. It intentionally does not return
thousands of job IDs; use the Jobs page/API for individual executions.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Confirmed set processed; inspect the outcome counts for partial results |
| 400 | Malformed selector or expected count |
| 409 | Eligible count changed; confirm again using `actual_count` |
| 500 | Executor unavailable or initial repository snapshot failed |

---

### Cancel a job

Cancel a running or pending job by its ID.

```
DELETE /api/jobs/:id
```

**Path parameters**

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | A job identifier from the `job_ids` array returned by `POST /api/jobs` |

**Response `data`**

```json
{
  "status": "cancelled"
}
```

**Example**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/1719800000
```

**Status codes**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Job cancelled |
| 400 | Job ID is required |
| 500 | Failed to cancel the job |

---

### List jobs

List archive jobs with pagination and optional filters.

```
GET /api/jobs
```

**Query parameters**

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `page` | int | `1` | Page number (1-based) |
| `limit` | int | `20` | Items per page; clamped to `1`–`100` |
| `status` | string | — | Filter by status; `all` (or omitted) returns all statuses |
| `repository` | string | — | Fuzzy (partial) match on repository **name or URL**, case-insensitive for ASCII. A URL term is normalized server-side (e.g. `https://github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve.git` matches the stored key `github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve`) (SQL `LIKE '%value%'`; `%`, `_`, and `\` in the value are matched literally) |

**Response `data`**

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": "1719800000",
      "name": "gitrieve",
      "url": "github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve",
      "status": "completed",
      "start_time": "2026-08-05T10:00:00Z",
      "end_time": "2026-08-05T10:02:30Z",
      "error_message": ""
    }
  ],
  "total": 42,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `jobs[].id` | string | Job ID |
| `jobs[].name` | string | Repository name |
| `jobs[].url` | string | Repository URL (from config) |
| `jobs[].status` | string | `pending` \| `running` \| `completed` \| `failed` \| `cancelled` |
| `jobs[].start_time` | string \| null | RFC3339 timestamp |
| `jobs[].end_time` | string \| null | RFC3339 timestamp, `null` if still running |
| `jobs[].error_message` | string | Error detail, empty on success |
| `total` | int | Total matching jobs (before pagination) |
| `page` | int | Current page |
| `limit` | int | Items per page |

Results are ordered by `start_time` descending.

**Examples**

```bash
# First page, default limit
curl http://localhost:8080/api/jobs

# Failed jobs only, page 2
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/jobs?status=failed&page=2&limit=50"

# Jobs whose repository name or URL contains "gitrieve" (fuzzy match)
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/jobs?repository=gitrieve"

# Match by URL (term is normalized server-side)
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/jobs?repository=github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve"
```

**Status codes**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Jobs returned |
| 500 | Failed to query jobs |

---

### List job components

Return the persisted component outcomes for one execution.

```
GET /api/jobs/:id/components
```

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "components": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "execution_id": "1719800000",
        "component": "code",
        "status": "completed",
        "start_time": "2026-08-05T10:00:00Z",
        "end_time": "2026-08-05T10:02:00Z",
        "error_message": ""
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "execution_id": "1719800000",
        "component": "wiki",
        "status": "skipped",
        "start_time": "2026-08-05T10:02:00Z",
        "end_time": "2026-08-05T10:02:01Z",
        "error_message": "repository has no wiki"
      }
    ]
  },
  "message": ""
}
```

`component` is `code`, `release`, `issues`, `wiki`, or `discussion`. Component
status is `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `skipped`, or
`cancelled`. Disabled optional components have no row. A legitimate unsupported
capability is `skipped` and does not fail the overall execution; any enabled
component `failed` makes the overall execution `failed`, although later
components are still attempted. Historical executions created before component
tracking return an empty `components` array.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Components returned |
| 400 | Job ID is empty |
| 404 | Execution does not exist |
| 500 | Component lookup failed |

---

### Stream job logs (SSE)

Stream the logs of a job in real time using Server-Sent Events.

```
GET /api/jobs/:id/logs
```

**Path parameters**

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | The job ID |

**Response**

- `Content-Type: text/event-stream`
- `Cache-Control: no-cache`
- `Connection: keep-alive`

Each log line is sent as a `data:` event terminated by `\n\n`:

```
data: {"id":1,"execution_id":"1719800000","timestamp":"2026-08-05T10:00:01Z","level":"info","message":"Fetching repository"}

data: {"id":2,"execution_id":"1719800000","timestamp":"2026-08-05T10:00:02Z","level":"info","message":"Archiving releases"}
```

A heartbeat comment (`: heartbeat\n\n`) is sent every 15 seconds to keep the connection alive. The stream closes automatically once the job reaches a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`), after flushing any remaining logs. The stream also stops if the client disconnects.

**Event payload**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | int | Log entry ID (monotonic) |
| `execution_id` | string | Job ID this log belongs to |
| `timestamp` | string | RFC3339 timestamp |
| `level` | string | Log level, e.g. `info`, `error` |
| `message` | string | Log text |

**Example**

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/1719800000/logs
```

`-N` disables curl's output buffering so events are printed as they arrive. In a browser, use the `EventSource` API:

```javascript
const es = new EventSource("/api/jobs/1719800000/logs");
es.onmessage = (e) => {
  const entry = JSON.parse(e.data);
  console.log(entry.timestamp, entry.level, entry.message);
};
es.onerror = () => es.close(); // stream ended by server or network
```

**Status codes**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Stream opened (then `text/event-stream`) |
| 400 | Job ID is required |
| 404 | Job not found |

## Repositories

Repositories are read from and written back to `config.yaml`. The `:id` path parameter is the repository **identity key** — the normalized URL (e.g. `github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve`) — not the name. Because the identity key contains slashes, the route is registered as a gin catch-all. Names are display labels and may repeat; the normalized URL is the unique key in the config.

### List repositories

List repositories from `config.yaml` (see [Configuration](../README.md#configuration)) with fleet health, server-side filtering/sorting, and pagination.

```
GET /api/repositories
```

**Query parameters**

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `page` | int | `1` | Page number (1-based) |
| `limit` | int | `20` | Items per page; clamped to `1`–`100` |
| `search` | string | — | Fuzzy (partial) match on repository **name or URL**, case-insensitive for ASCII |
| `health` | string | — | `healthy`, `failed`, `overdue`, `stuck`, `never_synced`, `cancelled`, `pending`, `running`, or `syncing` (`pending` plus `running`) |
| `overdue` | bool | — | `true` or `false`; independent of the primary health category |
| `stuck` | bool | — | `true` or `false`; independent of the primary health category |
| `sort` | string | `attention` | `attention`, `name`, `last_attempt`, or `last_success` |
| `direction` | string | `asc` | `asc` or `desc` |

**Response `data`** — a paginated object (not a bare array). Each item embeds the repository fields (PascalCase, matching the `repository:` config entries) plus lower-cased execution stats.

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "Name": "gitrieve",
      "URL": "github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve",
      "Cron": "0 * * * *",

      "last_status": "failed",
      "health_status": "failed",
      "last_attempt_time": "2026-08-05T10:02:30Z",
      "last_success_time": "2026-08-04T10:02:30Z",
      "last_duration_seconds": 151,
      "latest_execution_id": "1719800000",
      "last_error_message": "issues: API rate limit exceeded",
      "overdue": false,
      "stuck": false,
      "schedule_error": ""
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 6000,
    "healthy": 5800,
    "failed": 75,
    "pending": 10,
    "running": 15,
    "never_synced": 100,
    "cancelled": 0,
    "overdue": 120,
    "stuck": 2
  },
  "total": 6000,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `repositories[]` | object | A repository from config plus its per-run stats |
| `repositories[].Name` | string | Repository display name (identity is the URL) |
| `repositories[].URL` | string | Repository URL |
| `repositories[].Cron` | string | Cron schedule, empty if none |
| `repositories[].Storage` | array of string | Storage backend names |
| `repositories[].Type` | string | `repo` \| `user` \| `org` |
| `repositories[].OrgName` | string | Organization name for `user`/`org` types |
| `repositories[].last_run_time` | string \| null | RFC3339 timestamp of the most recent execution |
| `repositories[].next_run_time` | string \| null | RFC3339 timestamp of the next scheduled run (computed from `Cron`), `null` if no valid cron |
| `repositories[].total_runs` | int | Total executions for the repository |
| `repositories[].success_runs` | int | Executions that finished `completed` |
| `repositories[].failed_runs` | int | Executions that finished `failed` |
| `repositories[].last_status` | string | Raw latest execution status; empty when no execution exists |
| `repositories[].health_status` | string | Mutually exclusive display health category |
| `repositories[].last_attempt_time` | string \| null | Start time of the newest attempt, successful or not |
| `repositories[].last_success_time` | string \| null | End time of the newest overall `completed` execution |
| `repositories[].last_duration_seconds` | int \| null | Latest execution duration; active executions use elapsed time |
| `repositories[].latest_execution_id` | string | ID used by logs and component-detail endpoints |
| `repositories[].last_error_message` | string | Concise latest execution error summary |
| `repositories[].overdue` | bool | Whether the latest accepted attempt predates the latest cron occurrence outside the grace window |
| `repositories[].stuck` | bool | Whether the latest execution has run beyond the stuck threshold |
| `repositories[].schedule_error` | string | Invalid cron diagnostic; such a row cannot be classified overdue |
| `summary` | object | Fleet counts across all `search` matches, before health/overdue/stuck filters and pagination |
| `total` | int | Total matching repositories (before pagination) |
| `page` | int | Current page |
| `limit` | int | Items per page |

Other embedded repository fields (`UseCache`, `AllBranches`, `Depth`, `DownloadReleases`, `DownloadIssues`, `DownloadWiki`, `DownloadDiscussion`) are the boolean/int options from the config entry.

`last_attempt_time` answers when any attempt most recently began;
`last_success_time` answers when a fully successful backup most recently
finished. A newer failure therefore never makes an older successful backup look
fresh. Overall `completed` means every enabled component completed or was
legitimately skipped.

Health precedence is `never_synced`, `stuck`, active `pending`/`running`,
`failed`/`cancelled`, `overdue`, then `healthy`. Summary overdue/stuck counts
are independent diagnostics and can overlap the mutually exclusive status
counts. Summary counts cover the whole search-matched fleet, not just the
current page and not just rows selected by the health/overdue/stuck filters.

**Examples**

```bash
# All repositories, first page with the default limit
curl http://localhost:8080/api/repositories

# Fuzzy name or URL search
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/repositories?search=gitr"

# URL terms match too
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/repositories?search=github.com/wnarutou"

# Page 2 with a custom limit
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/repositories?page=2&limit=50"

# Combine server-side health diagnostics and attention ordering
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/repositories?health=failed&overdue=true&sort=attention"
```

**Status codes**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Repositories returned |
| 500 | Failed to query execution stats |

---

### Create a repository

```
POST /api/repositories
```

**Request body** — a repository object. `name` is required.

```json
{
  "name": "gitrieve",
  "url": "github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve",
  "cron": "0 * * * *",
  "storage": ["localFile"],
  "useCache": true,
  "allBranches": true,
  "depth": 0,
  "downloadReleases": true,
  "downloadIssues": true,
  "downloadWiki": true,
  "downloadDiscussion": true
}
```

Identity is the URL. A `repo`-type entry must supply a `url`; a `user`/`org` entry may omit `url` and set `orgName` instead — an empty URL is auto-synthesized to `https://github.com/<orgName>`. An entry with no identity (empty URL and no `orgName`) is rejected with `400`. Names may repeat: duplicate detection compares the normalized URL, and a conflicting URL returns `409`.

**Response `data`** — the created repository object.

**Example**

```bash
# repo-type entry with a URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/repositories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"gitrieve","url":"github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve","storage":["localFile"],"useCache":true}'

# org entry with no URL — the server synthesizes https://github.com/acme
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/repositories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"acme","type":"org","orgName":"acme"}'
```

**Status codes**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Repository added |
| 400 | Invalid body, missing `name`, or no identity (empty URL for `repo` type; empty `orgName` for `user`/`org` type) |
| 409 | A repository with that URL already exists (identity is the URL; names may repeat) |

---

### Update a repository

Partial update via JSON merge — only supplied fields are changed, unspecified fields keep their current value.

```
PUT /api/repositories/:id
```

**Path parameters**

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Repository identity key — the normalized URL (contains slashes; the route is a gin catch-all) |

**Request body** — any subset of repository fields.

{
  "cron": "0 */6 * * *",
  "allBranches": false
}
```

**Response `data`** — the merged, updated repository object.

**Example**

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/repositories/github.com/wnarutou/gitrieve \

```

**Status codes**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Repository updated |

|---|---|
| 200 | Storage backends returned |

---

### Create a storage backend

```
POST /api/storage
```

**Request body** — a storage object. `name` is required and `type` must be `file` or `s3`.

For a file backend:

```json
{
  "name": "localFile",
  "type": "file",
  "path": "./repo"
}
```

For an S3 backend:

## System

### Health check

```
GET /health
```

Returns whether the server is up. *(Note: the `/health` route is part of the server's planned system endpoints; confirm it is registered in your build before relying on it.)*

**Example**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

---

### Metrics

```
GET /api/metrics
```

Returns Go runtime metrics for the server process. *(Note: the `/api/metrics` route is part of the server's planned system endpoints; confirm it is registered in your build before relying on it.)*

**Example**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/metrics
```

---

## Config

Repository health uses two global duration settings:

```yaml
syncOverdueGrace: 30m
syncStuckThreshold: 24h
```

`syncOverdueGrace` delays missed-schedule classification until a cron
occurrence is outside its grace window. `syncStuckThreshold` flags a running
execution whose elapsed time is abnormally long. These are also the defaults;
non-positive values select the defaults. Both settings participate in config
load/save, export/import, apply, and reload.

### Export config

Returns the full current configuration as YAML — `repository`, `storage`, all
global options, and the `server:` section — formatted so the output can be used
directly as `config.yaml`. Secrets (`githubToken`, `secretAccessKey`,
`authToken`) are exported in plaintext; treat the file accordingly.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/config/export` | Export the full config as YAML |

**Response**

```json
{ "code": 200, "data": { "yaml": "repository:\n  - name: …" }, "message": "" }
```

### Preview an import

Parses, validates, and diffs a submitted YAML config against the current one.
Does **not** mutate any state. The diff is precise per repository / storage /
field: entries that are unchanged are omitted. Secrets in the diff are masked
as `***`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/config/import/preview` | Validate and diff an imported config |

**Request body**

```json
{ "config": "repository:\n  - name: …\n" }
```

**Response** (`200`)

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "summary": {
      "repositories": { "added": 1, "deleted": 1, "modified": 2 },
      "storages":     { "added": 0, "deleted": 0, "modified": 1 },
      "globals":      { "changed": 2 },
      "server":       { "changed": 1 }
    },
    "repositories": {
      "added":    [ { "key": "github.com/x/y", "name": "y", "url": "github.com/x/y" } ],
      "deleted":  [ { "key": "github.com/a/b", "name": "b", "url": "github.com/a/b" } ],
      "modified": [ { "key": "github.com/m/n", "name": "n", "url": "github.com/m/n",
                      "changes": [ { "field": "cron", "existing": "@daily", "imported": "" } ] } ]
    },
    "storages": {
      "added": [], "deleted": [],
      "modified": [ { "name": "local", "type": "file",
                      "changes": [ { "field": "path", "existing": "/tmp/one", "imported": "/tmp/two" } ] } ]
    },
    "globals": [ { "field": "githubToken", "existing": "***", "imported": "***" } ],
    "server":  [ { "field": "port", "existing": "8080", "imported": "9090" } ],
    "warnings": ["server 段已变更：该改动不会热生效，需重启 server 后生效。"]
  },
  "message": ""
}
```

**Errors** (`400`): invalid YAML or validation violations. Validation errors
carry the full list:

```json
{ "code": 400, "data": { "errors": ["repository \"orphan\" …"] }, "message": "导入配置无效" }
```

### Apply an import

Applies a previously-previewed import. `choices` select, per entry, whether the
imported or the existing value wins; entries without a choice use the defaults
(added/modified/globals/server → imported, deleted → keep). Choices for
entries the diff did not classify as changed/modified are ignored.
`repository_deletions` / `storage_deletions` only take effect for entries the
diff classified as deleted.

The `server:` section is **never hot-applied** — accepted changes are written to
`config.yaml` and take effect on the next server restart. A failure to persist
returns `200` with a `message` noting the change is in memory only. Repository
cron schedules are refreshed immediately after the import is applied.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/config/import` | Apply an import with per-entry choices |

**Request body**

```json
{
  "config": "repository:\n  - name: …\n",
  "choices": {
    "repository_deletions": ["github.com/a/b"],
    "repository_choices":   { "github.com/m/n": "imported" },
    "storage_deletions":    [],
    "storage_choices":      { "local": "existing" },
    "global_choices":       { "githubToken": "imported" },
    "server_choices":       { "port": "existing" }
  }
}
```

**Response** (`200`)

```json
{ "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "repositories_added": 1, "repositories_updated": 1, "repositories_deleted": 1,
    "storages_added": 0,     "storages_updated": 0,     "storages_deleted": 0,
    "globals_updated": 1,    "server_updated": 0
  },
  "message": "" }
```

### Reload config from disk

Re-reads `config.yaml` from disk and repoints the running server (API, executor,
and cron scheduler) at the fresh config. Repository cron schedules take effect
immediately. The `server:` section is not hot-applied and still requires a
restart. On any error the previous config stays active and a `400` is returned.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/config/reload` | Reload config.yaml at runtime |

**Response** (`200`)

```json
{ "code": 200, "data": {}, "message": "" }
```

### Web UI and static assets

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | Renders the web UI (`index.html`) |
| GET | `/static/*` | Static assets (CSS, JS) for the web UI |

These are not JSON APIs — the web UI is the intended way to interact with the endpoints above. See [Web UI guide](web-ui.md).
